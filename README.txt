The code writing and implementation of my project are using the Python Jupyter notebook named 'SBA prediction.ipynb'. This file can be operated on Jupyterhub or other Python coding platforms such as PyCharm. 

The raw data for this project is named 'SBAnational.csv'.


There are two HTML files to show the visualisation of the raw data by two different methods, 'SBA_Profiling_Report.html' is using the function ProfileReport from the Python package pandas-profiling and 'SBA_sweetviz_report_before.html' is using the Python package sweetviz.
